# ChordSwitcher
WEBFISHING GDWeave mod that allows players to swim in water!

## Features
- **Easy chord list switching:** Save up to 9 chord sets with 9 chords each!
- **Persistent:** You can save and load the chords from a file when you choose!
- **Export/Import/Share:** You can share the `custom_chords.json` file with others to help others play your songs!

## Keybinds
- `F1`-`F9`: load chord set 1-9
- `CTRL` + `F1`-`F9`: save chord set 1-9
- `SHIFT` + `F10`: load all chord sets from file
- `SHIFT` + `F11`: save all chord sets to file

## Files
This project writes/reads a single file to the same directory as your WEBFISHING save file, to `custom_chords.json`. *Your game save file is safe!*

## Installation
